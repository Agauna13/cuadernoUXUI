                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Born in Argentina and raised in Spain, I have dedicated most of my
                        professional life to customer service across various industries.
                        However, my passion for technology eventually inspired me to take
                        a bold step forward in my career. I pursued and earned the Spanish
                        DAW degree, equivalent to an Associate's Degree in Web
                        Development, which perfectly combines my enthusiasm for both
                        coding and design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I've developed strong communication skills,
                        problem-solving abilities, and a keen attention to detail, which
                        have been fundamental in my transition to web development. My goal
                        is to continue improving my technical skills and working on
                        projects that allow me to create engaging and responsive web
                        applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks such as
                        React and Bootstrap. I am always eager to learn new tools and
                        technologies to improve as a developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy learning about new tech trends, graphic
                        design, and working on personal web projects. I'm also passionate
                        about cinema and photography, which allow me to approach design
                        from a creative perspective.

                    <h2>My Work</h2>
                    <p>The starting point in my developement career was 2 years ago when I tried several online
                        tutorials about React but found the ammount of information a little overwealming and decided to
                        get involved in the DAW course to get a little structure and a title I can back my experience
                        with. </p>
